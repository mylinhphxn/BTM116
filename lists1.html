                <ul>
                    <li>Washington (/ˈwɒʃɪŋtən/ (audio speaker iconlisten)), officially the State
                        of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the Western United 
                        States. Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was formed
                        from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British
                        Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon
                        boundary dispute. The state, which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean,
                        Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia
                        to the north—was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the 
                        state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred 
                        to as Washington state to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington,
                        D.C.[4][5]</li>

                    <li>Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of years.[citation
                        needed] The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what
                        is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early-mid 16th century. As early as 1564, the
                        Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, riding the Kuroshio
                        Current in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. In 
                        1592, Juan de Fuca undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the
                        Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the strait now bearing
                        his name. Spanish ships – 250 in as many years – would typically not land before
                        reaching Cape Mendocino in California, but some landed or wrecked in what is
                        now Oregon. Nehalem tales recount strangers and the discovery of items like
                        chunks of beeswax and a lidded silver vase, likely connected to the 1707 wreck
                        of the San Francisco Xavier.[9]</li>

                    <li>Massachusetts (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ (audio speaker iconlisten), /-zɪts/), officially the
                        Commonwealth of Massachusetts,[a] is the most populous state in the New England region of
                         the United States. It borders on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Maine to the east,
                        Connecticut to the southwest and Rhode Island to the southeast, New Hampshire to the
                        northeast, Vermont to the northwest, and New York to the west. The capital of Massachusetts
                        is Boston, which is also the most populous city in New England. It is home to the Greater
                        Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and
                        industry.[45] Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade,[46] Massachusetts
                        was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.[47] During
                        the 20th century, Massachusetts's economy shifted from manufacturing to services.[48] 
                        Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education,
                        finance, and maritime trade.[49]</li>

            <li>Hawaii</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hawaii comprises nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500
                        miles (2,400 km) that are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion
                        of Oceania.[12] The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth longest in the U.S.,
                        at about 750 miles (1,210 km).[b] The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are
                        Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the 
                        state is named; it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion 
                        with the state or archipelago. The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most 
                        of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the nation's largest protected area and 
                        the third largest in the world.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>California</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>California is a state in the Western United States. California borders Oregon to the north,
                        Nevada and Arizona to the east, the Mexican state of Baja California to the south; and has
                        a coastline along the Pacific Ocean to the west. With over 39.5 million residents across
                        a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous
                        and the third-largest U.S. state by area. It is also the most populated subnational
                        entity in North America and the 34th most populous in the world. The Greater Los
                        Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second and fifth most
                        populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million
                        residents and the latter having over 9.6 million.[13] Sacramento is the state's
                        capital, while Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the second
                        most populous city in the country (after New York City). Los Angeles County is 
                        the country's most populous, while San Bernardino County is the largest county 
                        by area in the country (Alaska has some larger subdivisions, but they are not 
                        called counties). San Francisco, which is both a city and a county, is the second
                        most densely populated major city in the country (after New York City) and the
                        fifth most densely populated county in the country, behind four of New York
                        City's five boroughs.</li>
